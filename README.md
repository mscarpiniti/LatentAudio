# Generating new sounds by vector arithmetic in the latent space of the MelGAN architecture

This script implements the training of a MelGAN for generating new sounds that are then combined in a convex manner for new sonority. The idea is presented in paper [1], while the training is based on the MelGAN architecture [2] whose source code is available at: https://github.com/descriptinc/melgan-neurips/blob/master/scripts/train.py

The folder "Examples" contains some sounds generated by the proposed approach.

Specifically, we perform the linear combination of three test files and use this combination, after the mel spectrogram extraction, as input to the MelGAN.

The first case is regarding the linear combination: "*Mallet 2* - *String 1* + *Keyboard 1*". The resulting spectrogram is shown below.

For the second combination, we use the linear combination: "*Keyboard 1* + 0.4 x *Organ 2* - 0.4 x *String 4*". The resulting spectrogram is shown below.

Finally, the third linear combination is: "0.4 x *Organ 3* - 0.4 x *String 1* + 0.9 x *Organ 1*". The resulting spectrogram is shown below.
