# Generating new sounds by vector arithmetic in the latent space of the MelGAN architecture

This script implements the training of a MelGAN for generating new sounds that are then combined in a convex manner for new sonority. The idea is presented in paper [1], while the training is based on the MelGAN architecture [2] whose source code is available at: https://github.com/descriptinc/melgan-neurips/blob/master/scripts/train.py

The folder "Examples" contains some sounds generated by the proposed approach.
