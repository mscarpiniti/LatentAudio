# LatentSound
Generating new sounds by vector arithmetic in the latent space of the MelGAN architecture

This script implements the training of a MelGAN fpr generating new sounds that are then combined for new sonority. The idea is presented in the following paper:

Uncini, “Generating new sounds by vector arithmetic in the latent space of the MelGAN architecture”, in *Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Neural Systems to Data Science* (A. Esposito, M. Faundez-Zanuy, F. C. Morabito and E. Pasero, Eds.), ISBN: , pp. , Springer 2023.

The folder "Examples" contains some sounds generated by the propose approach.
